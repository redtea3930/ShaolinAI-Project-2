Karen,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,You can&#8217;t miss its bludgeoning message which is nailed into every scene&#46; You also can&#8217;t miss the complete lack of inspired storytelling&#44; the astonishingly bad dialogue&#44; or characters so poorly conceived that it&#8217;s impossible to connect with them&#46;,NEGATIVE,-2.0

Karen,Dolores Quintana,Dolores Quintana,"I do feel that KAREN is actually a decent effort and a decent example of what a KAREN is, which I think is useful to the world. It's kind of trashy, but fun in the exploitation film kind of way.",POSITIVE,-2.0

Karen,Nathaniel Muir,AIPT,The movie never even tries being content to take a bunch of the stories everyone has seen off the internet and use it in its plot. Lazy and insulting.,NEGATIVE,-2.0

Karen,Erik Childress,eFilmCritic.com,While the film blindly jumps headstrong into 'so bad it's good' territory it nevertheless features a committed performance by Taryn Manning that holds our attention through laughable attempts at racial awareness.,NEGATIVE,-2.0
Karen,Peter Gray,This is Film,"[Coke] Daniels' film however feels more like a bad SNL sketch, where his intention of social commentary and his ability to execute genre thrills both woefully misguided.",NEGATIVE,-2.0
Karen,Anne Brodie,What She Said,The film hits all the notes you'd expect.,NEGATIVE,-2.0
Karen,Prairie Miller,WBAI Radio,"Methinks The Karens Doth Protest Too Much.

Jigsaw,Kim Newman,Screen International,"It remains to be seen whether Jigsaw can hook in new generations of horror fans or bring back the crowds which supported the highly profitable earlier films, but this genuinely is a fitting jumping-on point for the Saw saga.",POSITIVE,-57.0

Jigsaw,Jordan Crucchiola,New York Magazine/Vulture,"Saw cleans up pretty well in these modern times: This is the first movie that actually looks sort of expensive, and it trades the sickening green color palette of the first seven efforts for actual daylight.",POSITIVE,-57.0

Jigsaw,Fred Topel,We Live Entertainment,"The traps are much higher tech than John Kramer's old rusty Rube Goldberg machines, but they remain true to his spirit of anticipating your every move before you even knew you were going to make it. That's what's important.",POSITIVE,-57.0
Jigsaw,Luke Y. Thompson,Wizard,"...this is a capable enough Saw sequel, definitely better than parts 4, 5, and 7.",POSITIVE,-57.0
Jigsaw,Rob Leane,Den of Geek,"The cast just about sells it all ... making the brisk runtime fly by. You'll wince, you'll wile away 90 minutes, and you'll struggle to work it all out... what more do you expect from a Saw film?",POSITIVE,-57.0
Jigsaw,Kim Newman,Empire Magazine,"If you don't like Saw, this isn't going to change your mind - but it's skilful, satisfying schlock and respectful of its fanbase. And the final death is a show-stopping coup de grace.",POSITIVE,-57.0
Sound of Freedom,Maria Latilla,WhyNow,"Sound of Freedom arrives in UK cinemas with a distinct stench of controversy.

She Hulk: Attorney at Law,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,When word first hit that Marvel was officially producing a She Hulk series    many Marvel fans were over the moon! But when we learned Orphan Black star Tatiana Maslany would be starring as the main hero Jennifer Walters    aka She Hulk saying opinions were mixed wouldve been an understatement. As a teenager    I bought the run of She Hulk   2014 2015       written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Javier Pulido    for its gorgeous cover art by my favourite working artist Kevin Wada. Still    I fell in love with Jen    her story    and her sense of humour. And as a former mega fan of Orphan Black    having witnessed the range and talent of Tatianas work on the show    I had incredibly high hopes for SheHulk. Hopes that after watching the first four episodes    I can confirm that was not misplaced! While the episodes arent very long    just over 30 minutes    with credits and a post credit scene    they never felt rushed. Every scene has purpose    and while bursting at the seams with humour    it has moments that allow comedy to breathe. A mix of physical humour and puns keeps its comedic tone centred. A fan favourite reaction to the trailer was Jen breaking the fourth wall    which seems incredibly natural and doesnt remove from the viewing experience altogether. Another personal favourite was all the cameos from both past and new characters. I particularly love Madiysonn and her relationship with Wong and their dynamic. Every person   who I wont name for spoilers sake    did a fantastic job. My favourite was a particular pop icon I wasn’t expecting. The episodes post credit scene had me in tears; it was something I didn’t know I needed until I saw it. Suffice to say    Jennifer Walters isnt going to let a little Hulk business ruin her hot girl summer! I think the tone for She Hulk    Attorney at Law    is perfect for what the MCU currently needs. After the solemn tone of Falcon and the Winter Soldier and the crushing themes in WandaVision    shows like Ms. Marvel and She Hulk give a much needed breath of fresh air to phase four. It’s also refreshing to see a woman in her 30s have such an established career and daily life as a single working Hulk. I thought the explanation of how Jen can hone her powers as quickly as she does is also incredibly poignant and crucial to her character. As a woman living her day to day life    shes constantly in danger    continually having to keep calm and manage her temper because if not    shed be labelled as emotional or possibly put her life at risk. With this    I think it would have added a lot of depth to Jens character if she had been cast as a Black or non Black actress of colour to highlight even more the ways women of colour are painted to be the aggressor. But you cant always get what you want. Regardless    I resonated with Jen at that moment. Her physical transformation can express the anger she feels daily in its entirety. It also gives me a lot of hope for the young women out there watching the show    showing them that they can have whole    productive    successful lives at any age    and you don’t necessarily have to be a superhero to do it. Theres a lot of pressure for people assigned female at birth   AFAB    to either A. Have a family and produce children very quickly    or B. Have your life figured out by your mid 20s.The reality of our world is that most women and AFABs dont know what they want to do or who they are. Jen is a stark contradiction to that. She’s a well to do lawyer living in LA with a strong familial bond; she adores her best friend and paralegal    Nikki. She wants love despite having little time for it with all her work to get justice for her clients    even if she might not see eye to eye with them immediately. So far    Ive only been given access to the first four episodes of She Hulk    and immediately I wanted more. Jen is my favourite phase four character so far    and I cannot wait to see her role in future endeavours. Im sure she’d fit nicely alongside some Avengers with her familial link to Bruce Banner and eye catching style. Whatever Jen does in the future    Ill be in her corner    as I’m sure many MCU fans will be. Dont miss out on She Hulk; definitely one of the best series Disney + has produced yet!,POSITIVE,45.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"There is no denying that Amazon Primes Lord of the Rings   The Rings of Power is off to a promising, immersive start. If we take the networks short but sweet discography, quality content is an undercurrent that’s thrusting it forward in the trenches of streaming services. Shows like The Expanse  later seasons , The Wheel of Time, and even Paper Girls have a top tier quality to them that can  and should  be viewed on the big screen. Thats especially the case for the first two episodes of The Lord of the Rings long anticipated prequel series. While we cannot disclose anything plot related, we can confirm that the series is thoughtful and considerate of the stories it wants to tell. There are a myriad of stories within this shows expansive world, and the first two episodes are well aware of this notion. There will be a lot to discuss when the time comes and theories take a float, which says enough about the quality of storytelling. The thing about a fantasy series is that every audience member is drawn to a different thing. The expanse of world building is critical to an engaging narrative, and that’s always been the case with this franchise. The series understands this, and thus far, it allows the characters to take a front seat in driving the plot forward. Theres plenty that could change when the series progresses, but generally, promising beginnings as such tell us more than what we need to know. And with The Lord of the Rings   The Rings of Power, especially its cast is hauling trenches to create something incredible. To be so innately impressed by everyone this early on is a rarity in and of itself. Still, Morfydd Clark is an absolute marvel as Galadriel an easy character to attach ourselves to right from the start. We could spend hours just gawking about this seriess visual effects, which demand to be viewed on the biggest screens possible, curtains drawn, and everything blacked out as dark as possible. Brilliant shots are expected from a show like this, but the amount that we get is awe inspiring. Truly. The production design and the years of hard work are apparent from the moment the story begins and until the credits start to role. And while we were already enamored with Bear McCrearys original score, hearing the tracks in the scenes they belong in is an adventure for which there are no words. In short, The Rings of Power is captivating thus far. Theres so much to be told here, and were waiting with bated breath to dive further into it. Its not always easy to rewatch episodes of a lengthy fantasy series, but it’s going to be an effortless feat with this show, and surely, every rewatch will bring about further discoveries, making the story that much more enamoring.",POSITIVE,50.0
