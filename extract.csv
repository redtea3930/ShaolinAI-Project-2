Sound of Freedom,57,Maria Latilla,WhyNow,"Sound of Freedom arrives in UK cinemas with a distinct stench of controversy. The film has been accused of being QAnon-adjacent and described as faith based, much to director Alejandro Monteverde’s annoyance as he told us in our exclusive interview.",NEGATIVE,-42.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"When word first hit that Marvel was officially producing a She Hulk series    many Marvel fans were over the moon! But when we learned Orphan Black star Tatiana Maslany would be starring as the main hero Jennifer Walters    aka She Hulk saying opinions were mixed wouldve been an understatement.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"As a teenager    I bought the run of She Hulk   2014 2015       written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Javier Pulido    for its gorgeous cover art by my favourite working artist Kevin Wada.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"I fell in love with Jen    her story    and her sense of humour. And as a former mega fan of Orphan Black    having witnessed the range and talent of Tatianas work on the show    I had incredibly high hopes for SheHulk. Hopes that after watching the first four episodes    I can confirm that was not misplaced!",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"While the episodes arent very long    just over 30 minutes    with credits and a post credit scene    they never felt rushed. Every scene has purpose    and while bursting at the seams with humour    it has moments that allow comedy to breathe. A mix of physical humour and puns keeps its comedic tone centred.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"A fan favourite reaction to the trailer was Jen breaking the fourth wall    which seems incredibly natural and doesnt remove from the viewing experience altogether. Another personal favourite was all the cameos from both past and new characters. I particularly love Madiysonn and her relationship with Wong and their dynamic.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"Every person   who I wont name for spoilers sake    did a fantastic job. My favourite was a particular pop icon I wasn’t expecting.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"The episodes post credit scene had me in tears; it was something I didn’t know I needed until I saw it. Suffice to say    Jennifer Walters isnt going to let a little Hulk business ruin her hot girl summer! I think the tone for She Hulk    Attorney at Law    is perfect for what the MCU currently needs.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"After the solemn tone of Falcon and the Winter Soldier and the crushing themes in WandaVision    shows like Ms. Marvel and She Hulk give a much needed breath of fresh air to phase four.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"It’s also refreshing to see a woman in her 30s have such an established career and daily life as a single working Hulk. I thought the explanation of how Jen can hone her powers as quickly as she does is also incredibly poignant and crucial to her character.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"As a woman living her day to day life    shes constantly in danger    continually having to keep calm and manage her temper because if not    shed be labelled as emotional or possibly put her life at risk.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"With this    I think it would have added a lot of depth to Jens character if she had been cast as a Black or non Black actress of colour to highlight even more the ways women of colour are painted to be the aggressor. But you cant always get what you want. Regardless    I resonated with Jen at that moment.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"Her physical transformation can express the anger she feels daily in its entirety. It also gives me a lot of hope for the young women out there watching the show    showing them that they can have whole    productive    successful lives at any age    and you don’t necessarily have to be a superhero to do it.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"Theres a lot of pressure for people assigned female at birth   AFAB    to either A. Have a family and produce children very quickly    or B. Have your life figured out by your mid 20s.The reality of our world is that most women and AFABs dont know what they want to do or who they are. Jen is a stark contradiction to that.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"She’s a well to do lawyer living in LA with a strong familial bond; she adores her best friend and paralegal    Nikki. She wants love despite having little time for it with all her work to get justice for her clients    even if she might not see eye to eye with them immediately.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"So far    Ive only been given access to the first four episodes of She Hulk    and immediately I wanted more. Jen is my favourite phase four character so far    and I cannot wait to see her role in future endeavours.",POSITIVE,45.0
She Hulk: Attorney at Law,77,Keshav Kant,Off Colour,"Im sure she’d fit nicely alongside some Avengers with her familial link to Bruce Banner and eye catching style. Whatever Jen does in the future    Ill be in her corner    as I’m sure many MCU fans will be.",POSITIVE,45.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"There is no denying that Amazon Primes Lord of the Rings   The Rings of Power is off to a promising immersive start. If we take the networks short but sweet discography quality content is an undercurrent that’s thrusting it forward in the trenches of streaming services.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"Shows like The Expanse  later seasons  The Wheel of Time and even Paper Girls have a top tier quality to them that can  and should  be viewed on the big screen. Thats especially the case for the first two episodes of The Lord of the Rings long anticipated prequel series.",POSITIVE,50.0

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"There will be a lot to discuss when the time comes and theories take a float which says enough about the quality of storytelling. The thing about a fantasy series is that every audience member is drawn to a different thing.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"The expanse of world building is critical to an engaging narrative and that’s always been the case with this franchise. The series understands this and thus far it allows the characters to take a front seat in driving the plot forward.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"Theres plenty that could change when the series progresses but generally promising beginnings as such tell us more than what we need to know. And with The Lord of the Rings   The Rings of Power especially its cast is hauling trenches to create something incredible.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"To be so innately impressed by everyone this early on is a rarity in and of itself. Still Morfydd Clark is an absolute marvel as Galadriel an easy character to attach ourselves to right from the start.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"We could spend hours just gawking about this seriess visual effects which demand to be viewed on the biggest screens possible curtains drawn and everything blacked out as dark as possible. Brilliant shots are expected from a show like this but the amount that we get is awe inspiring. Truly.",POSITIVE,50.0
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,83,Gissane Sophia,Marvelous Geeks Media,"The production design and the years of hard work are apparent from the moment the story begins and until the credits start to role.
